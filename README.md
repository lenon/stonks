# stonks

This repository contains a Python project that I developed to manage my investment portfolio in the
Brazilian stock market. The project uses Pandas for data analysis and is intended to replace the
complex Excel spreadsheet I previously used.

The code is available for anyone to use, but please note that I cannot guarantee its accuracy. Use
it at your own risk.

## Requirements

* [pyenv][pyenv-instructions] to switch to the correct Python version.
* [Poetry][poetry-instructions] to install dependencies.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```
git clone git@github.com:lenon/stonks.git && cd stonks
```

Install the correct Python with pyenv:

```
pyenv install
```

And then install dependencies with Poetry:

```
poetry install
```
